# Termish

A javascript based terminal for the web, by the web, to control the web. It let's you write your javascript scripts (or from other script authors), host them at a remote location, and run them from a terminal, in a safe, secure, sandboxed environment to do all kinds of stuff.

Check out the `repo` directort for some sample scripts that we wrote.

# Running

This is a static site! 'nuff said.

# Why?

Because it's fun and profitable to write javascript to do all kinds of stuff. And using a terminal makes jack a very productive boy!

Right now, we have some very simple use cases covered, as evidenced in the `repo` folder. But this is far from it's potential.

Some potentially cool uses:
    `tweeface <message>` will tweet a message to your twitter feed and publish to facebook as well.
    `gcal "meeting at 5"` will book your google calendar.
    `pocket <url> <time>` will add the url to your pocket and remind you to read it at the time using a reminder email.
